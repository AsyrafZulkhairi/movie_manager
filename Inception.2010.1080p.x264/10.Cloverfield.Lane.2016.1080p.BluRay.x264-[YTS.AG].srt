or anything. (CHUCKLES)

how do we get out of here?

About...

172
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,433
Getting out of here
is the last thing you want to do.

173
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,911
Because the air up there,

174
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,554
it's contaminated.

175
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,038
HOWARD: I see you've met Emmett.

176
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,028
What happened to him?

177
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,997
He did that to himself.

178
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,960
And his stumbling around
isn't helping anything.

179
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,152
What you heard earlier,

180
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,199
was him knocking over a shelf
with a whole week's worth of food,

181
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,236
which he's sorry for, correct?

182
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,029
Totally.

183
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,830
Let's go. Bathroom time.

HOWARD: This is the common area.

186
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,798
Good for R & R.

187
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,553
As you can see,
I've planned for a long stay.

188
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,470

cleans the air and keeps it fresh.

This is the living room.
Help yourself to any reading.

190
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,790
If you like to watch films,
I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.

191
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,676
Just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they're done.

192
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,635
The kitchen's fully functional.

Has an electric stove,
refrigerator, freezer, silverware.

194
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,158
And that table's a family heirloom,

195
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,832
which means watch your glasses.

196
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,071
Always use coasters and placemats.

197
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,271
Keep your hands to yourself!

198

Understand?

199
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,193
No touching.

200
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200

I give express permission.

- You will, though.

And I've got to pace
these things out, so please.

207
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,159
I need privacy.

not to burn this place down.

If you had heard a car,
the driver would be long dead by now.

Well, shouldn't we at least try

229
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,079
to call the police or someone
to find out what actually happened?

230
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,991
There's no one left to call.

You have seat belts in your cars.

You have alarm systems
to protect your homes.

But what do you do
when those alarms go off?

some stuff with satellites.

while you're building his bomb shelter.

295
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,237

296
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,153
the air is contaminated
and everybody's dead.

297

about the air, some big attack,

the purpose of this shelter, is a lie.

What do you mean?

00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,990
I was on my way home from work.

306
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,676
And it looked like a flash.

307
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,873
Bright red.

308
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,194

It wasn't like fireworks.

310
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,591
Naw, this was more like
something you'd read about in the Bible.

311
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,990
So, what, you saw, what,
a flash of light? Lightning?

312
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,353
A fire that flared up?

313
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,629
I'm not explaining it right.

314
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,950
This wasn't like anything I'd ever seen.

315
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,109
And so, my first thought
was to come here.

316
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,431
And when I got here,
Howard was closing the door.

317
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,795
And I could see it,
right there on his face,

318
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,472
he knew something was happening.

319
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,753
Something bad.

320
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,151
And so, I fought my way in.

321
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,114
I heard a car.

322
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,391
Right here. Above us.

323
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,673
You heard someone?

324

Right above us.

That isn't possible.

326
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,117
- The air is...
- What, contaminated?

327
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,952
- How do you know that?
- Because I told him.

328
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,759

329
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,234
I see you two are getting along.

330
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Hmm.

331
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,913
How's that sauce?

332
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
It's fine.

333
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,190
As cooks go, I'm okay.

334
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,151
Not great, but okay.

335
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,791
Megan was a good cook.

336
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,231
You'll learn to love cooking.

337
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,154
Mmm...

338
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,154
EMMETT: Mmm.

339
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,593
It's delicious.

340
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,591
That's the best sauce I've ever tasted.

341
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,673
Are you being funny?

342
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,159
No, I mean,

343
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,593
considering the alternative,
which is, you know,

344
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,434
getting burnt up in a chemical attack,
or nuclear,

345
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,878
I'd say being alive and down here would

346
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,269
make a fried turd taste pretty good, so...

347
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,752
Best damn sauce I ever had.

348
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,596
That's not a bad point.

349
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,671
And, please,
watch your language at table.

350
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,074
Right?

351
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,553
You know what I haven't been able to
get out of my head, for some reason?

352
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,471
Ever since I got down here.

353
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,473
Tattoos.

354
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,878
Always wanted one.

355
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,640
But I never got any.
'Cause everybody always said,

356
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,200
"No, no, Emmett, you'll never get
a decent job if you do that."

357
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,675
Whatever.

358
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,432
Like that matters now, right?

359
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,636
T ell you what,
if I had known this was coming,

360
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,156
I would've gotten, like,
50 of them. I swear, man.

361
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,675
I would look like a circus freak,
or something.

362
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,239
I'd just be covered head to toe.

363
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,595
Tattoos all over my...
You know, everywhere. Face?

364
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,592
Sure. Right there. Across my forehead.

365
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,674
Just my name. "Emmett."

366
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,919
Or, you know,

367
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,478
- "Thug Life."
- (CHUCKLES)

368
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,835
"YOLO."

369
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,069
I don't even know what that means,

370
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,673
but, you know,
I hear people saying it all the time,

371
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,000
so, it must be cool. (CHUCKLES)

372
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,834
Hey, what about you, Howard?

373
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,351
Anything you wish you'd done?

374
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,912
In all honesty, no.

375
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,275
No?

376
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,990
No crazy nights in Vegas?

377
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,428
Maybe, uh, take a pilgrimage to Waco?

378
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,075
Everything I wanted to do, I did.

379
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,757
I focused on being prepared.

380
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,439
And I was.

381
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,519
And here we are.

382
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,958
EMMETT: Oh, my goodness.

383
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,473
Is that Monopoly?

384
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,559
There we go!

385
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,517
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.

386
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,477
What would you say, Howard,
we're gonna be down here,

387
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,915
what, like, a year? Two? Maybe?

388
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,672
I bet you if we started a game right now,

389
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,432
we might even
get halfway finished by the time...

390
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,754
Stop talking!

391
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,959
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

392
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,390
You don't need to make jokes about
how long we're going to be down here

393
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,948
when nobody knows
how long that's going to be.

394
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,670
Your humor is not funny.

395
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,671
I don't appreciate it
while I'm trying to eat,

396
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,800
and neither does Michelle.

397
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,271
Now, please shut up
and let us eat in peace.

398
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,149
Hmm.

399
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Emmett?

400
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,152
Would you pass me a napkin?

401
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,474
Thank you.

402
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,075
I know what you're saying.
I never could finish <i>Monopoly.</i>

403
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,274
That game really
does take forever, right?

404
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,158
For me, though, it was, um...

405
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,353
<i>Chutes and Ladders,</i>

406
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,029
uh...

407
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,233
<i>Sorry!,</i>

408
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,072
and <i>Trouble.</i>

409
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,754
You know, the thing with the dice
and the thing that you pressed,

410
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,558
- what was that called?
- The...

411
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,234
BOTH: Pop-O-Matic bubble! Yeah.

412
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,920
Did you ever play that, um...
What was that, <i>Operation?</i>

413
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,274
- Loved <i>Operation!</i>
- I'm telling you, man,

414
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,429
I couldn't play that game.

415
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,669
- It terrified me.
- Why...

416
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,275
That noise that thing would make
when you hit that edge. I mean...

417
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,590
- Good Lord!
- (CHUCKLING) It was pretty scary.

418
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,680
Could you hand me the salt?

419
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,589
Please?

420
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,074
Ah, shoot! I'm sorry.

421
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,198
I'm gonna need the pepper also.

422
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,632
What exactly do you think you're doing?

423
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,755
I'm asking for pepper.

424
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,239
Like hell you were! What was that?

425
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,713
I don't know what you're
talking about, Howard.

426
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,109
Are you trying to insult me?

427
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,153
Here, in the shelter that I built
that's keeping you alive?

428
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,073
You don't think I see what you just did?

429
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,478
Is that how you thank me
for saving your life?

430
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,760
- Howard, calm down.
- Shut up!

431
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,355
Shut up and stay in your seat!

432
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,195
Is it?

433
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,391
Now, let me tell you,

434
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,349
I know what a traitor looks like.

435
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,793
Understand?

436
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,231
I have shown you nothing,
but generosity and hospitality.

437
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,751
I want you to apologize.

438
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,955
To tell me you're going to behave.

439
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,268
I will.

440
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,273
You will what?

441
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,473
I'll behave.

442
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,797
And I'm so sorry.

443
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
HOWARD: Sit.

444
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,439
(HOWARD SIGHING)

445
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,279
Ah...

446
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,277
Have to stay hydrated.

447
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,709
Hmm.

448
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,710
That's easy to forget down here.

449
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,588
What's wrong?

450
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,314
(SOFTLY) Nothing.

451
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,715
Where are my keys?

452
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,028
(RUMBLING)

453
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,239
(SCREAMS)

454
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,032
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

455
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,317
- Michelle!
- (GRUNTS)

456
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,994
(GROANS)

457
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,598
(PANTING)

458
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,156
Michelle! Stop!

459
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,392
Give me those keys!

460
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,871
MICHELLE: Come on.
HOWARD: No! Don't!

461
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,832
(MICHELLE PANTING)

462
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,679
Stop!

463
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,319
No! No, don't! Don't!

464
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Don't open that door!

465
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,313
(PANTING)

466
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,319
There's a car!

467
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,834
- There's a car! I see a car!
- HOWARD: No!

468
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,994
Here! Here! Here!

469
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,594
HOWARD: Michelle,
listen to me, don't do this!

470
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,679
- (THUD)
- (GASPS)

471
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,796
Oh, God! Thank God!

472
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,510
- There's a woman.
- WOMAN: Open the door!

473
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,832
(STUTTERING) It's okay.
I just want to come inside.

474
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,990
She looks hurt.
She wants me to let her in.

475
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,548
Do not let her in!

476
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,393
- Look at her face, Michelle!
- No!

477
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,790
No, no, no!

478
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,554
No!

479
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,438
Oh, my God, I'm fine. I really am fine.

480
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,034
- No, please, I'm okay.
- There's...

481
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,237
It really only...
It only touched me a little. A little!

482
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,392
So, could you open the door? Open it!

483
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,314
- She's begging me.
- You can't help her!

484
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,515
No one can!

485
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,636
Let me in. I'll be okay.

486
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,837
I'll be okay.
It really hardly touched me at all.

487
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,754
- Open the door!
- HOWARD: Don't listen to her!

488
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,912
God! Open the door, you bitch!

489
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,479
Let me in!

490
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,949
Let me in! Let me in!

491
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,197
